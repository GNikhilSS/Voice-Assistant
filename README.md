# Voice-Assistant
# Description:
I have developed a simple voice assistant using Python. My main tech stack only includes Python. I used Python to implement features like receiving user commands through voice, generating bot responses, and accomplishing certain actions that a user would likely do. Through this app, he will be able to open certain apps on his PC or go to specific web pages. They can also have the time displayed, weather, and others. More actions can be added by merely modifying the action page.

Speech-to-Text Functionality
The Speech_to_text.py program has a function that accepts the user's voice command, converts it to text, and returns it. It uses the SpeechRecognition library and the Recognizer method to recognize the audio. It uses other methods such as listen and recognize_google to convert the speeches to text. It makes it easy to capture voice commands accurately and then convert them into text for the assistant to understand and act on. The reliability and accuracy of the SpeechRecognition library ensure that the assistant is able to understand a wide range of voice inputs, enhancing its usability and effectiveness.

Text-to-Speech Functionality
The program Text_to_speech.py includes a function that enables any text to be converted into speech. This replicates the speech of the assistant. The pyttsx3 library contains methods such as getProperty and setProperty. The facilities provided by pyttsx3 in this allow the assistant to talk back to the user with a human voice, thus enriching the user experience because the user gets to hear what the command does. Personalization options, like the speed of speech and the type of voice used, are available with pyttsx3 and so make the interaction more personal.

Weather Functionality
The Python program, weather.py, includes a function that permits the determination of the weather of an area in real time. It uses the library HTMLSession. This looks for the weather in a given city, then the temperature and kind of weather by matching their class values. In this way, the user will can obtain updated information about the weather in their location or any other city in which he might have interest. Real-time in this feature provides most current updates on weather, thus making this feature very useful for planning daily activities.

Action functionality
In the program action.py, the file contains all the actions that can be performed with the aid of an app. Here, you can add more actions which are customizable. You can add whatever you could, from wishing the user to goodbye. These have been already implemented. This makes the assistant very flexible, with the capability to perform a wide array of tasks based on user preferences. Such ease in adding or modifying actions brings flexibility to the assistant to evolve according to the user's needs.

User Interface
The program interface.py is made up of all the styling, buttons, and more of those elements that make the app more like an app. It uses the tkinter library. It also employs the PIL library to display any image of your liking. This shall ensure the app not only works great but also looks great and is user-friendly. The employment of Tkinter in making the Graphical User Interface gives the App access to users of all technical levels, while PIL adds in the visual experience with custom image incorporation.

Conclusion
This is a very basic voice assistant and often quite pleasant to work with in terms of automating a few things here and there throughout the day. Imagine using VS Code pretty often. Just ask, and it will open. Because of the introduction of not only speech recognition but also real-time weather information, customizable actions, and the constant user interface, this voice assistant ease will be in your hands to raise productivity and comfort. Be it making your workflow easier, knowing the weather, or just doing everyday things more efficiently, let this assistant help you.

These functional abilities will facilitate and speed up the conduction of daily routine activities with this voice assistant. Inclusion of libraries in Python like SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, HTMLSession, tkinter, and PIL will enhance the assistant to be highly capable and support a whole range of functionalities. Any further changes could also be done by the user depending upon the demands, which will further make it a flexible and multifunctional tool both in personal and professional space.

Thank you.
